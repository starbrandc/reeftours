                        Mnemba Island, 2 miles (3.2km) to the north-east of the island of Zanzibar (Unguja), is surrounded by a vast coral reef measuring several miles in diameter. Listed as a marine reserve, it is the most popular snorkeling spot in Zanzibar. Moorish idols, blue tang and clownfish are easy to see in a few feet of water, above a colorful, well-preserved reef. <br><br>
                        Mnemba Island is a privately owned island with access restricted to guests of the luxurious &Beyond Mnemba Island. Tour guides will drop you off directly at the reef, which lies a few hundred yards from the small island. The full-day excursion from 9am to 3pm if you opt to go with a mixed boat (Not private) generally include a single snorkeling stop at Mnemba as well as a lunch break on the beach and a chance to observe dolphins on a lucky day!
