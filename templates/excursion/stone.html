                    <h6>Stone Town Zanzibar</h6>
                    <p class="nohyphen p3">Set out with your guide from your hotel and travel into the heart of Stone
                        Town, the oldest section of Zanzibar City.
                        As you navigate your way through winding streets marked by buildings with elaborately carved
                        doors and elegant verandas, learn how Arab,
                        Indian, Persian, and European influences have blended with local Swahili traditions to shape the
                        city's architecture and history. <br><br>

                        Survey the hustle and bustle of the Darajani Market, which retains the lively atmosphere of the
                        bazaars that took place on the island for centuries.
                        Then, discover a dark reminder of the city's past as you step into former slave chambers, which
                        stand as the sole remnant of what was once a slave market.
                        Next, delve into the history of the sultans who once ruled Zanzibar at the Sultan's Palace,
                        which was built in the late 19th century. <br><br>

                        Next door lies the House of Wonders, a grandiose second palace that currently houses the
                        National Museum of History and Culture.
                        After browsing exhibits dedicated to Zanzibar's multicultural heritage, wrap up your tour with
                        time for shopping before returning to your hotel.</p>
