                    <h6>Dolphin Safari</h6>
                    <p class="nohyphen p3">The dolphins are officially protected by the 420 km2 Menai Bay Conservation Area, which was set up in 1997 to stop the rapid depletion of fish stocks. 
                        We will depart from the shores of Kizimkazi fishing village in search of dolphins. Snorkeling gear is available for you.  <br><br>
                        The boat will take you out into the clear turquoise blue Indian Ocean where the odds of meetings dolphins are about 80%. Reef Tours & Travel gives contribution to the protection of dolphins in the waters of Kizimkazi. 
                        <br><br>
                        We encourage our skippers not to chase the dolphins and we advise visitors to enter the water away from the dolphins with as little disturbance as possible, staying close to the boat, avoiding sudden movement and allowing the dolphins to come to you. On busy days with many tourists this however is not possible. 
                        <br><br>
                        After the exhilarating experience of swimming with the dolphins, you can also do snorkeling for a while before we will head back to shore. The trip takes about 3 hours starting very early in the morning.</p>
